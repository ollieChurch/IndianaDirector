I am the 2022 winner of the JMK Award with my show, ‘The Solid Life of Sugar Water’ by Jack Thorne which played at the Orange Tree Theatre Oct/Nov 22. As a disabled artist I am passionate about making theatre that’s representative of the world we live in, that champions unheard voices and that is authentic and raw. I am committed to trying to change the theatre landscape to represent the disabled community more widely in the arts. I want to make Theatre that puts disabled voices at the centre of the story. I started working professionally as a director in 2016 and have had the privilege of working with new writing, Shakespeare and musicals across a number of different and exciting venues. From 2018-2021 I worked as the assistant director and producer at The Guildford Shakespeare Company working on site specific theatre.",
